# Study TensorFlow Federated

## Trịnh Công Vinh - 20021478 - K65N-CLC - UET

## Product report for the course: 2223H_INT4002_70

+ This repo will be the basic installation and usage for the TFF framework compiled by vinhtc27 from the official page of [TFF](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated)

## The TensorFlow Federated ([TFF](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated)) platform consists of two layers:

- Federated Learning (FL), high-level interfaces to plug existing Keras or non-Keras machine learning models into the TFF framework. You can perform basic tasks, such as federated training or evaluation, without having to study the details of federated learning algorithms.

- Federated Core (FC), lower-level interfaces to concisely express custom federated algorithms by combining TensorFlow with distributed communication operators within a strongly-typed functional programming environment.
